# Problem No. 3

## Flatten List.
Flattening a list of lists is a process of transforming a two-Dimensional list into a One-Dimensional list by un-nesting every list element kept in the list of lists

For example:
    
                i/p: [[9, 8, 7], [6, 5, 4], [3, 2, 1]] 
                o/p: [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Write a function **flatten(input_list: list)** (*where **input_list** is a nested list with random depth*)  in solution.py which will flatten the input_list and return the flattened list.
