# Problem No. 5

## Merge Two Sorted Arrays.

Example:  

                    Input: nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0], m = 3, nums2 = [2, 5, 6], n = 3 
                    Output: [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6]

Write a function **merge_list(list1: list, list2: list)**, in solution.py to merge given two sorted lists into single sorted list.
