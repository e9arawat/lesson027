# Problem No. 8

## Intersection of Two Arrays.

Example:  

                    Input: nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2] 
                    Output: [2]

Write a function **find_intersection(list1: list, list2: list)**, in solution.py to find their union (all unique elements from both arrays).
