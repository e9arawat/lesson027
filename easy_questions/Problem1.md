# Problem No. 1

## Write a Python program to check if a string is a palindrome.

A palindrome is a number or letter that remains the same even if the number and letters are inverted.

 For example:
                    121, 11, 414, 1221, 74747 are the palindrome numbers.
                    MOM, DAD, MADAM, REFER are the palindrome letters.       
                    JAVATPOINT, PROGRAM, JAVA are not the palindrome letters.

Find the value of $d \lt 1000$ for which $1/d$ contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.

Update the function `answer()` in `solution.py` with your solution.
