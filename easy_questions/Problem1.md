# Problem No. 1

## Write a Python program to check if a string is a palindrome.

A palindrome is a number or letter that remains the same even if the number and letters are inverted.

 For example:
 
                    121, 11, 414, 1221, 74747 are the palindrome numbers.
                    MOM, DAD, MADAM, REFER are the palindrome letters.       
                    JAVATPOINT, PROGRAM, JAVA are not the palindrome letters.

Update the function `solver()` in `solution.py` with your solution.
