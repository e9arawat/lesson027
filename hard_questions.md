# Problem No. 1

## Number to words conversion

Write a function **number_to_words(n: int)** which will convert the given number in word format and return the number of letters in the word format of the given number.

For example:
 
                    Input : 895654
                    Output: eight hundred and ninety five thousand six hundred and fifty-four


# Problem No. 2

Given two strings, write a function **longest_common_subsequence(p, q)** which will the longest common subsequence.

For example: 

              Input: s1 = "ABCD", s2 = "ACDF" 
              Output: "ACD"


# Problem No. 3

Non-repeating character is the character that only occurs once.

Write a function **non_repeating(input_string: str)** to find the first non-repeating character.

For example:
    
                Input: "leetcode" 
                Output: 'l'




# Problem No. 4

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, `a < b < c`, for which, `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`

Write a function **pythagorean_triplet(p, q)**, to find all pythogorean triplets whose sum lies between `p` and `q`, inclusive, and return a dictionary where the key is the sum and the value is a list of all tuples whose sides add up to the key.

Example:  

                Input:  pythagorean_triplet(12)
                Output: {12: [(3, 4, 5)]}





# Problem No. 5

You are given a list of integers. You have to find the maximum sum that can be obtained from any sub-list

Write a function **maximum_sum(input_list: list)**, to find the maximum sum of any sublist. 

Example:  

                    Input: [-1, -2, 3, 4, -1, 2, -1, 2, -1, -4, 2, -1] 
                    Output: 11 --> (3 + 4 + -1 + 2 - 1 + 2)




# Problem No. 6

Write a function **create_palindrome(input_list: list)**, to find the minimum number of elements that should be removed from the list inorder to make the list palindrome.

Example:  

                    Input: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 2, 1, 1] 
                    Output: 2 ---> (5,4)



# Problem No. 7

givrn a 'n'*'m' matrix, write a function **total_paths(n, m)**, to find the total number of 'unique' ways from (0,0) index to (n,m) index given that we can go in right and downward direction

Example:  

                    Input: n=3, m=3 
                    Output: 6





# Problem No. 8

Given a list and a number as input, write a function **solver(input_list, target)**, to find the two numbers in the list whose sum is equal to the number given in the input. Use only one for loop. 

Example:  

                    Input: solver([1, 2, 3, 4], 6) 
                    Output: (2,4)



# Problem No. 9

Given a string, write a function **longest_substring(input_string: str)**  to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. 

Example:  

                    Input: "abcabcbb" 
                    Output: "abc"




# Problem No. 10

Given a string, write a function **longest_palindrome(input_string: str)**  to find the length of the longest palindrome substring.

Example:
                    Input: "abcdedcc"
                    Output: "cdedc"
